## Introduction

OCRA is a collaborative, web-based tool to support conservation-restoration workflows by enabling annotation of high-resolution 3D models of cultural heritage objects. Designed with iPad support for field use by conservators


The OCRA App has various roles for the users of the system, including:
- Admin User: Full system access, user management, vocabulary control
- Project Leader: Create projects, manage team hierarchy, assign tasks
- Editor: annotation tools, semantic mapping, collaboration
- Viewer: Read-only access, export capabilities

The OCRA App is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React. The main entry point is `App.tsx`, which handles routing and authentication.
