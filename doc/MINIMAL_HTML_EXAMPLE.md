# Minimal HTML Example - Created Successfully! 🎉

## What Was Created

A **minimal standalone HTML example** (`basic.html`) that demonstrates 3D model viewing with Three.js - just **95 lines** including styling!

### File Location
```
frontend/src/lib/three-presenter/examples/basic.html
```

## Features

✨ **Zero dependencies** - Uses Three.js from CDN  
🎮 **Interactive** - Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom  
💡 **Lit scene** - Ambient + directional lighting  
📏 **Ground grid** - Visual reference plane  
🎨 **Auto-centering** - Model automatically positioned  
📱 **Responsive** - Adapts to window resize  

## Code Breakdown

**Total: 95 lines**
- Styling: ~25 lines
- Three.js setup: ~40 lines  
- Model loading: ~20 lines
- Animation/resize: ~10 lines

## How to Run

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to examples directory
cd frontend/src/lib/three-presenter/examples

# Start HTTP server (choose one):
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx http-server -p 8000
# or
php -S localhost:8000

# Open in browser:
# http://localhost:8000/basic.html
```

### What You'll See

1. **Dark gray background** with a lit 3D scene
2. **Venus model** centered on a grid
3. **Info panel** (top-left) with instructions
4. **Interactive camera** - drag to rotate, scroll to zoom

## File Structure

```
examples/
├── README.md           # Documentation
├── basic.html          # Minimal example (95 lines)
└── assets/
    └── venus.glb       # 3D model
```

## Technical Details

### Uses Three.js from CDN
```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js';
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';
```

### Simple Scene Setup
```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(40, aspect, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
```

### Model Loading
```javascript
const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load('./assets/venus.glb', (gltf) => {
  // Auto-center and add to scene
});
```

## Benefits

### For Development
- ✅ **No build step** required
- ✅ **Fast iteration** - just refresh browser
- ✅ **Easy debugging** - plain JavaScript
- ✅ **No framework** - pure Three.js

### For Documentation
- ✅ **Self-contained** - one HTML file
- ✅ **Easy to share** - copy & run
- ✅ **Clear example** - shows essentials only
- ✅ **Works anywhere** - any HTTP server

## Browser Requirements

- ✅ Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ ES6 modules support
- ✅ WebGL support
- ✅ Import maps support (built into modern browsers)

## What's Not Included (Kept Minimal)

To keep it under 100 lines, the example excludes:
- ❌ ThreePresenter wrapper (uses Three.js directly)
- ❌ Annotation system
- ❌ UI controls builder
- ❌ Custom file resolvers
- ❌ Environment maps
- ❌ Multiple models

These features can be added in more advanced examples.

## Next Steps

### Test It Now
```bash
cd frontend/src/lib/three-presenter/examples
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open: http://localhost:8000/basic.html
```

### Extend It
Use this as a base for:
- Adding ThreePresenter wrapper
- Implementing annotations
- Custom lighting setups
- Multiple model loading
- Animation controls

## Files Created

1. `frontend/src/lib/three-presenter/examples/basic.html` (95 lines)
2. `frontend/src/lib/three-presenter/examples/README.md` (documentation)
3. `frontend/src/lib/three-presenter/examples/assets/venus.glb` (model - already existed)

## Verification

### Line Count
```bash
wc -l basic.html
# Result: 95 lines ✅
```

### Dependencies
- Zero npm packages
- Uses CDN for Three.js
- No build process needed

## Success! 🎉

You now have a **minimal, standalone HTML example** that:
- ✅ Is under 100 lines (95 lines total)
- ✅ Shows 3D model rendering
- ✅ Requires no build step
- ✅ Uses the Venus model
- ✅ Has interactive camera controls
- ✅ Can run on any HTTP server
- ✅ Perfect for testing and demos
