# Docker Build Fix - Summary

## Issue

Docker compose build was failing with the following error:

```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error While resolving: @types/react-dom@19.1.9
npm error Found: @types/react@18.3.26
```

## Root Cause

The `frontend/Dockerfile` had a **redundant and problematic** line:

```dockerfile
RUN npm ci || npm install
RUN npm install bootstrap  # ❌ This line caused the issue
```

### Why This Failed

1. `npm ci` installs all dependencies from `package-lock.json` (including bootstrap)
2. Then `npm install bootstrap` tries to install bootstrap again
3. This triggers npm to re-resolve dependencies
4. Causes a peer dependency conflict between `@types/react@18` and `@types/react@19`
5. Build fails

## Solution

Removed the redundant `RUN npm install bootstrap` line from the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Before
RUN npm ci || npm install
RUN npm install bootstrap

# After
RUN npm ci || npm install
```

Bootstrap is already listed in `package.json`, so `npm ci` installs it automatically.

## Files Modified

- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Removed line 9 (`RUN npm install bootstrap`)

## Verification

### ✅ Build Test
```bash
docker compose build app
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - Built successfully

### ✅ Container Start
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - All containers running

### ✅ Container Status
```bash
docker compose ps
```
**Result:** All containers healthy:
- ✅ ocra-frontend (port 3001)
- ✅ ocra-backend (port 3002)
- ✅ ocra-postgres (port 5432)
- ✅ ocra-mongodb (port 27017)
- ✅ ocra-keycloak (port 8081)

## Access Points

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3002
- **Keycloak**: http://localhost:8081

## Related Changes

This fix is part of the ThreePresenter reorganization work. The Dockerfile was previously modified to remove 3DHop-related commands, and this redundant bootstrap installation line should have been removed then as well.

## Prevention

Going forward:
- Don't run `npm install` after `npm ci` in Docker builds
- All dependencies should be in `package.json`
- Let `npm ci` handle installation from lockfile
- Only use `npm install <package>` if genuinely adding a new package
